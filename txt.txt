To push your project to GitHub and perform various Git operations, follow these detailed steps. This guide assumes you are familiar with basic command-line operations and have Git installed on your system.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Navigate to Your Project Directory**:
   Open your command line interface (CLI) and change the directory to where your project is located. In your case:
   ```bash
   cd C:\Users\Admin\hello
   ```

2. **Initialize a Git Repository**:
   If you haven't already initialized a Git repository in your project folder, do so with:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```
   This command creates a new `.git` subdirectory in your project folder, which tracks all changes.

3. **Add Files to the Staging Area**:
   To add all files in your project to the staging area, use:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```
   The `.` represents all files in the current directory. You can also add specific files by replacing `.` with the filename.

4. **Commit Your Changes**:
   After staging the files, commit them with a descriptive message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```
   This command saves your changes and prepares them for pushing to the remote repository.

5. **Add Remote Repository**:
   Link your local repository to the remote GitHub repository. Replace `<your-repo-url>` with your actual GitHub repository URL:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/vidhyasenthilkumar/arara.git
   ```

6. **Push Your Changes to GitHub**:
   To push your committed changes to GitHub, use:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```
   Here, `-u` sets the upstream for the `main` branch, meaning future pushes can be done simply with `git push`.

7. **Subsequent Pushes**:
   For any future changes after the initial push, you can simply run:
   ```bash
   git push
   ```
   This will push all new commits from your local branch to the corresponding branch on GitHub.

### Explanation of Each Command

- **`git init`**: Initializes a new Git repository.
- **`git add .`**: Stages all modified and new files for commit.
- **`git commit -m "message"`**: Commits staged changes with a message describing what was changed.
- **`git remote add origin <url>`**: Links your local repository to a remote repository on GitHub.
- **`git push -u origin main`**: Pushes changes to the `main` branch on GitHub and sets it as the default upstream branch for future pushes.
- **`git push`**: Pushes any new commits to the remote repository without needing to specify the branch again.
